# Redwood on Docker

> :warning: This repository has been deprecated and archived in favor of the [official support in RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/docker). Thanks to everyone that contributed to this repository, and to everyone that worked on bringing offical support.

This is a collaboration repository to consolidate efforts on making sweet Docker implementations for RedwoodJS. Discussion on [Dockerize RedwoodJS](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/dockerize-redwoodjs/2291) and [Define official Docker images](https://github.com/redwoodjs/docker/issues/16). This repository is currently up to date with Redwood version `3.8.0`.

## Contribution

Essentialy we create various test implementations under the [docker](docker) directory and create [workflows](.github/workflows) to build these. Once we find a suitable approach forward, we'll discuss where the final Dockerfiles ultimately end up after a `yarn rw setup docker` (or what we end up with) setup. ðŸš€

### Dockerfiles

Add below `LABEL` to bottom each Dockerfile to connect published Docker image to this repository.

```Dockerfile
### Connect image to repository
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source=https://github.com/redwoodjs/docker
```

#### Images

Published Docker images to GitHub Container Registry should preferably be named;

- `docker-<prefix>-api-dev` for api build with development as runtime env.
- `docker-<prefix>-web-dev` for web build with development as runtime env.
- `docker-<prefix>-both-dev` for api and web build with development as runtime env.
- `docker-<prefix>-api-prod` for api build with production as runtime env.
- `docker-<prefix>-web-prod` for web build with production as runtime env.
- `docker-<prefix>-both-prod` for api and web build with production as runtime env.

e.g.

- `docker-jeliasson-nginx-web-dev`

### Benchmarks

To keep track of the implementations effectiveness, we maintain a running average on below metrics.

- **Build Size**: On successful builds we display the image size in the analyse stage. In this stage we also run a [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive#ci-integration) analysis.
- **Build time**: Average time for 'Docker build' completion in respective workflow.

### CI

Feel free to copy and paste `.github/workflows/template.yml` and we try to make out a common baseline. It should build and publish the image(s) to GitHub Container Registry (see template).
